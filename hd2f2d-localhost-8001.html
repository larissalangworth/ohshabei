I recently accepted a position where I have access to a really nice Linux server (56 threads 256G Ram) and we are currently in the process of getting access to an even larger server (100+ threads with 2TB Ram) -- we have a lot of heavy lifting to do. At my previous position I used a server with remote desktop and it was clunky so I'm trying spend some time getting familiar with a good setup early in order to increase my productivity and workflow later. I'm looking for recommendations on workflow. 
phpmyadmin / localhost:8080 localhost 8080. Localhost:8080 address is a apache php server publishing address using 8080 port number on localhost. I have a growing list of web servers I need to develop on, usually I connect to them via the browser like so: `localhost:8000`, `localhost:8001` , etc. Essentially run each server on it's own port. Managing these ports and remembering which one belongs to what project is just cumbersome. Ideally I would like to access my projects like so: `proj1.local`, `proj2.local`, etc. I'm on macos and I am familiar with the `/etc/hosts`, but this won't solve the issue in regards to multiple ports The connection to the Web server for page ' was lost. Failed to connect to an IPC Port: Access is denied.

Hello, I need ideas (if not outright help) with the docker setup on my home server. I have multiple applications that I would like to run on my sole machine. I imagine every application would have its docker-compose file and, since they have nothing in common, will be on its own docker network. (right now everything runs in its virtual machine) I thought of using a reverse proxy as a separate container (did some tests with nginx already) but I don't seem to be able to access containers  
phpmyadmin / localhost:8080 localhost 4200. Localhost 4200 is a localhost server access port number. You can login the port from url address. I am using node js with the soap module 'node-soap' version 0.24.0 (latest). I am implementing a api framework with the following wsdl file, server.js file. For organisational reasons the wsdl operation is just like a sample template similar to structure of original code.When I make a SOAP request, its being processed successfully but in the response , namespace part in the tags is coming as undefined. This is causing problems to our client who will be making the api calls My current setup is a few machines all handling a uniform collection of the same endpoints, with a round-robin strategy for load balancing requests. I would like the load balancing machine itself to be one of the machines used for the round-robin. To pull this off, I was trying to reverse proxy to the upstream 'round-robin-machines' with a prefix of /api/, then have locations with paths accepting endpoints with that prefix.

I'm in the process of setting up a server that will host multiple sites running on Apache, Nginx and Node. It is a staging server for clients to preview their website before deploying to a production server in an unknown environment. My basic requirements for this are: Server can host Apache, Nginx and Apache each with unique configs - e.g. a php 7.1 Symfony install on Nginx, a php 5.6 WordPress install on Apache etc. Each site will sit on its own subdomain - e.g. example1. I have just installed CouchBase Server Enterprise v2.0.0 using the setup.exe on my Windows 7 64bit machine and supposedly the Browser based Console should appear automatically after installation. 
I've written some code for two clients to chat on a server, but I'm having trouble displaying the client's messages on one another's windows. For instance, the server window displays the entire conversations, but the clients windows only display their own messages. How would I go about displaying the client's messages to one another? Any help would be appreciated. Here's my code: Server `import java.io.BufferedReader;` `import java.io.IOException;` `import java.io.InputStreamReader;`. In computer networking, 127.0.0.1 is a special purpose IP address conventionally used as a computer's loopback address. I am using Cognito's hosted UI for login to my Python Flask app. I've setup Cognito to be a OAuth provider, and the login works fine. The logout is proving to be problematic though. I've replaced the href of the logout button to not point to the built-in logout method on the app, but to rather hit the Cognito logout URL. Here's the URL: https://ltmy_domaingt.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com/logout?response_type=codeampclient_id=ltclient_idgtampredirect_uri=http://localhost:8001/. Using the WLS Administration Console.  If the Administration Server is on the same machine as the browser, then ensure that requests sent to localhost or 127.0.0.1 are not sent to the proxy. The Administration Console is accessible via a URL in the following. 
I'm having some trouble logging a user out of my application. It is a Flask App Builder application, but that just extends the normal flask_login module, so it's normal Flask basically. I am using AWS Cognito as an OAuth provider. When I click Log out, the application logs out and I am redirected to the login screen. If I click Login again though, I am taken directly to the home page, no need to enter my credentials again. I found the Cognito logout endpoint, and if I hit that endpoint directly.
