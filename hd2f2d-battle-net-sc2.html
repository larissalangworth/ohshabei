Hello r/starcraft! I've been trying to get into Starcraft 2 for a while now. The main reason why I want to play it is because it's a highly praised RTS with an active player base, and it seems to offer a lot of depth.

Hey folks, In my neverending quest to keep the lore community discussions afloat, I’m going to try a new weekly series and see if it takes off or not. I know a lot of people are either new to the SC series with the SCII campaign, or just only play the games so don’t get a lot of the context the books, web stories, expanded maps and comics provide.
